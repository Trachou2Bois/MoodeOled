# MoodeOLED

[Français](README.fr.md)

MoodeOLED is a user interface for an SSD1306 128x64 OLED screen to control [Moode Audio](https://moodeaudio.org/) via an IR remote control or GPIO buttons.

---

## ✨ Features

- **NowOLED**: Displays the current track, metadata, playback status, hardware info, etc. Media controls, add/remove favorites (follows the playlist configured in Moode), playback modes, renderers (Bluetooth, Airplay, and UPNP), search for the currently playing artist in the music library… And a little extra: Logs radio track titles (via the "favorites" button) into a text file to list them in the menu, and lets you search them via yt-dlp and replay them via a local stream/radio (no download).
- **NavOLED**: Browse the music library, search, move, copy, delete to/from local or USB storage.
- **QueOLED**: Displays and manages the playback queue. Playlist creation.
- **Configuration help and IR remote mapping**: Assisted and fully customizable LIRC configuration with conflict detection. Ability to add custom actions to unused keys in MoodeOLED (see the `handle_custom_key` function in `media_key_actions.py`... *to be made more user-friendly*).
- **(Untested) GPIO and rotary encoder support** using `lgpio`. Requires enabling and configuring pins in `config.ini` under the "manual" section.
- **ZRAM configuration** for low-memory devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero 2W).
- Automatic integration with Moode’s "Ready Script" for smooth startup.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install git
   git clone https://github.com/Trachou2Bois/MoodeOled.git
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   
   ```bash
   python3 ~/MoodeOled/install/setup.py
   ```
   
   - Detects Moode version.
   - Installs APT and Python dependencies.
   - Configures I²C if disabled.
   - Creates a virtual environment (`~/.moodeoled-venv` by default).
   - Offers ZRAM configuration if <1 GB RAM detected.
   - Installs systemd services.
   - Offers LIRC installation.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

---

## 🖥 Services

The following systemd services are created during installation:

| Service      | Description                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `nowoled`    | Displays "Now Playing" screen|
| `navoled`    | Music library navigation     |
| `queoled`    | Playback queue display       |
| `pioled-off` | Turns off OLED screen at shutdown |

Switch between the 3 main display scripts using the `KEY_BACK` button.

---

## 🎛 IR remote configuration

MoodeOLED includes an interactive script to configure LIRC:

```bash
python3 ~/MoodeOLED/install/install_lirc_remote.py
```

Features:

- Install and configure LIRC.
- Hardware test (`mode2`, `irw`).
- Download a configuration from `irdb-get`.
- Learn a remote control (`irrecord`).
- **Mapping editor**:
  - Reassign all keys or individually.
  - Conflict detection (confirmation if a key is already mapped).
  - Warning if mapping a system key (e.g., `KEY_UP`).

Mappings are stored in `config.ini`:

```ini
[remote_mapping]
#KEY_MOODEOLED = YOUR_REMOTE_KEY
# Required keys
KEY_PLAY = KEY_PLAYPAUSE
KEY_BACK = KEY_ESC
...
# Optional keys
KEY_FORWARD = KEY_FASTFORWARD
KEY_NEXT = KEY_NEXTSONG
```

---

## ⌨ GPIO and rotary encoder support

MoodeOLED uses `lgpio`, you can configure GPIO buttons or rotary encoders in `config.ini`.

Example:

```ini
[manual]
use_gpio = true
use_rotary = true

[buttons]
KEY_PLAY = 17
KEY_STOP = 27

[rotary]
pin_a = 22
pin_b = 23
pin_btn = 24
```

## **🎛 Key configuration**

### 🔑 Essential keys

These keys are **required** to navigate and control all interfaces:

| Key                  | Generic role                                      | Specific usage in `nowoled`                                |

These keys must be configured either via LIRC (`python3 ~/MoodeOLED/install/install_lirc_remote.py`) or via GPIO (`[buttons]` section in `config.ini`).

### 🎵 Optional media keys

Recommended if available on your remote, but **not mandatory**:

## 🔧 Configuration via tools menu in nowoled

A small on-screen configuration menu allows you to change:

- Screen sleep delay  
- Local stream quality (radio favorites)  
- Language (currently English and French)  
- Enable/disable debug mode  

---

## 🧠 ZRAM on low-memory devices

If the Raspberry Pi has less than **1 GB RAM** (e.g., Zero 2W):

- The installer offers to install `zram-tools` and configure ZRAM (280 MB, lz4).
- Completely disables swap.

---

## ⚠️ Moode configuration reminder

In **Moode > System Config**:

- Enable **Ready Script** (System).
- Enable **LCD Updater** (Peripherals).
